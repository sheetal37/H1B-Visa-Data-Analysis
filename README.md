Project Title: H1B Visa Data Analysis and Visualization

Objective: To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes and analyzes H1B visa data, providing insights into application trends, approval rates, employer distributions, and regional demands. This project aims to help stakeholders understand patterns in visa applications and make informed decisions.

Data Sources:
H1B Visa Dataset: Typically obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) or other relevant government databases.
Additional Data (if available): Labor market data, employer data, and regional economic indicators.
Key Metrics and KPIs:
Application Trends: Number of applications over time, by year, quarter, and month.
Approval Rates: Percentage of approved vs. denied applications.
Employer Distribution: Top employers by number of applications and approvals.
Regional Analysis: Applications and approvals by state or metropolitan area.
Job Titles and Occupations: Common job titles and occupational categories for H1B visa holders.
Wage Analysis: Average wages offered by employers, segmented by occupation and region.
Industry Trends: Distribution of applications by industry sector.
Data Preparation:
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, incorrect data entries, and standardize formats.
Data Transformation: Aggregate data as needed, create calculated columns for metrics like approval rates.
Data Integration: Combine H1B visa data with additional datasets if necessary.
Power BI Dashboard Components:

Features and Interactivity:
Slicers: Allow users to filter data by year, state, employer, occupation, and industry.
Drill-through: Enable users to drill down from high-level metrics to detailed data views.
Tooltips: Provide additional context and details when hovering over data points.
Bookmarks: Save and share specific views or insights for easy reference.
Deliverables:
Power BI Report: Interactive dashboard with multiple pages for different aspects of the analysis.
Documentation: Description of the data sources, methodology, and interpretations of visualizations.
Presentation: Summary of key findings and insights for stakeholders.
Timeline:
Data Collection and Preparation: 2 weeks
Power BI Dashboard Development: 3 weeks
Testing and Iteration: 1 week
Final Review and Presentation: 1 week
Potential Challenges:
Data Quality: Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the dataset.
Complexity of Analysis: Handling large volumes of data and creating meaningful visualizations.
User Requirements: Understanding and incorporating specific needs of stakeholders into the dashboard design.
Success Criteria:
User Feedback: Positive feedback from stakeholders on the dashboardâ€™s usability and insights.
